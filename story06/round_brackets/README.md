# round_brackets

Write a function `RoundBrackets` that evaluates the validity of the order of round brackets '(' and ')' in a given string. The function should ignore all other characters in the string and check if every opening bracket '(' has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket ')'.

**Function definition:**

```go
func RoundBrackets(s string) bool {

}
```

**Example:**

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(RoundBrackets("()()()"))   // true
	fmt.Println(RoundBrackets("(salem)"))  // true
	fmt.Println(RoundBrackets(")(1)(f)(")) // false
	fmt.Println(RoundBrackets("))(()"))    // false
	fmt.Println(RoundBrackets(""))         // false
}
```
