# sqrt

Write a function `Sqrt` that calculates the square root of a given number. if that square root is a whole number it returns int value, otherwise `-1`.

**Function definition:**

```go
func Sqrt(x int) int {

}
```

**Example:**

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(Sqrt(16)) // 4
    fmt.Println(Sqrt(1))  // 1
    fmt.Println(Sqrt(3))  // 0
    fmt.Println(Sqrt(-4)) // 0
}
```

**Program output:**

```sh
$ go run main.go
4
0
$
```
