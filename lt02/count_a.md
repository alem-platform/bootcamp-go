# count_a

In the boundless realm of programming, akin to an intricate tapestry of logic and creativity, there lie challenges that beckon the curious and the determined. Imagine yourself as an intrepid explorer, venturing into the enigmatic wilderness of code, where each line is a step towards unraveling the mysteries of data manipulation and string processing. This particular quest is designed to test your mettle in handling and navigating through collections of data, specifically slices of strings in the elegant language of Go.

Picture a scenario where you are a skilled scribe, tasked with the important duty of analyzing ancient manuscripts. Each manuscript, a string, holds secrets and stories encoded within its characters. Among these characters, the letter ‘a’ stands as a beacon you must tally. The frequency of ‘a’ may unlock hidden messages, or perhaps it’s a test from the grand masters of the coding guild to assess your precision and efficiency.

You will embark on a journey to write a function, CountA, that will traverse these manuscripts, tallying the occurrences of the ‘a’ character. This function is more than a simple count; it is a testament to your ability to weave through each string with the finesse of a master weaver, ensuring no ‘a’ goes unnoticed. Your code must be both elegant and efficient, capable of handling the smallest parchment to the most voluminous tome.

Consider the diverse nature of the manuscripts you might encounter. Some might be devoid of the ‘a’ character, barren lands where no ‘a’ has taken root. Others might be rich and fertile grounds, teeming with ‘a’s scattered throughout. You must prepare for every possibility, crafting a solution that is as versatile as it is robust.

The echoes of this task reach far beyond the confines of a mere exercise. It reflects real-world applications where character frequency analysis is paramount, from spell-checkers and text analyzers to complex data parsers. Mastering this task will arm you with the knowledge and skills to face such challenges head-on, with the confidence and capability of a seasoned coder.

Write a function `CountA` that takes a slice of strings and returns the total number of 'a' characters in all the strings.

**Function definition:**

```go
func CountA(slice []string) int {

}
```

Example:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(CountA([]string{"apple", "banana", "avocado"})) // 6
    fmt.Println(CountA([]string{"xyz", "uvw", "rst"}))          // 0
    fmt.Println(CountA([]string{"aardvark", "alpaca", "ant"}))  // 7
}
```
