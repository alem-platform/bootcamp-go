# find_first_a

In a distant future, within the vast expanse of the digital cosmos, data streams flow like rivers of light, and code is the language that binds the universe together. You are a code navigator, an adept technomancer, tasked with deciphering the intricate patterns within these streams. On this mission, you must deploy your skills to craft a function capable of pinpointing a specific signal within the noise: the elusive ‘a’ character.

Your mission is to develop a function, FindFirstA, that will traverse a slice of strings—data packets in this digital realm—and locate the first occurrence of the ‘a’ character. This function must be keen-eyed and efficient, scanning through each string in the slice until it encounters its target. Should the ‘a’ character remain hidden, cloaked within the vast expanse of other data, the function must return an empty string, signifying the absence of the desired signal.

Imagine yourself aboard a sleek data cruiser, zipping through the binary stars and constellations of code. Each string you encounter is a fragment of a larger message, a piece of a puzzle that your function must decode. The first ‘a’ it finds could be the key to unlocking further secrets of this digital universe, a beacon in the vast sea of information.

Prepare for the unexpected. Some strings may be long and complex, others short and simple. The ‘a’ could be at the beginning, buried deep within, or perhaps not present at all. Your function must navigate these scenarios with the precision of a laser, cutting through the ambiguity to deliver its result.

This task reflects the broader challenges faced in data analysis and text processing within the ever-evolving landscape of technology. By mastering this mission, you will enhance your ability to parse and interpret data, a crucial skill in the ongoing quest to tame the digital frontier.

Write a function `FindFirstA` that takes a slice of strings and returns the first 'a' character it encounters in any of the strings. If there is no 'a' in the slice, return an empty string.

**Function definition:**

```go
func FindFirstA(slice []string) string {

}
```

Example:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(FindFirstA([]string{"hello", "world", "alpha"})) // "a"
    fmt.Println(FindFirstA([]string{"bcd", "efg", "hij"}))       // ""
    fmt.Println(FindFirstA([]string{"java", "python", "go"}))    // "a"
}
```
