# gcd

Write a function `GCD` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers.

> The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that can divide both of them without leaving a remainder.
> 
> For the numbers 12 and 18:
> - The divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
> - The divisors of 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.
> - The largest number that both lists share is 6.
> 
> So, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.

**Function definition:**

```go
func GCD(a, b int) int {

}
```

Example:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(GCD(48, 18)) // 6
    fmt.Println(GCD(101, 103)) // 1
    fmt.Println(GCD(56, 98)) // 14
}
```
