# lcm

Write a function `LCM` that calculates the least common multiple of two integers.

> The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.
> 
> For the numbers 4 and 5:
> - The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
> - The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...
> - The smallest number that appears in both lists is 20.
> 
> So, the LCM of 4 and 5 is 20.

**Function definition:**

```go
func LCM(a, b int) int {

}
```

Example:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(LCM(4, 6)) // 12
    fmt.Println(LCM(21, 6)) // 42
    fmt.Println(LCM(5, 7)) // 35
}
```
