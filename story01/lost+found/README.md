<p data-story-username="amirhan">I see that you are curious. Curiosity is good. I was once curious too, wanting to understand how everything works and to change the world for the better. I still do. But I sometimes doubt whether I chose the right path and the correct formula.</p>

### Task

Create a script `find_force.sh`, which prints full path to a file with a filename `force` in `lost+found` directory.

> Use `find` command.
