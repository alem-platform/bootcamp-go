Congratulations on completing the second crunch! Now, it's time for an important part of the process: assessing your fellow team members. This evaluation won't affect the final XP (apologies for the confusion in the first crunch), but it is crucial for us to better understand your group dynamics and will be considered at the end of the bootcamp.

Please be responsible and respectful to your fellow teammates and file it by Monday, June 17, 11 AM. For each teammate, you will have to file a separate form from scratch. 
Thank you for your help!
