Congratulations on completing the first crunch! Now, it's time for an important part of the process: assessing your fellow team members. This review is designed to fairly spread experience points (XP) based on how active, supportive, and helpful everyone was on your team during the crunch.

This review is required to receive your crunch XP. Please be responsible and respectful to your fellow teammates and file it 
by Monday, June 10, 9 AM. For each teammate, you will have to file a separate form from scratch. 
Thank you for your cooperation!
