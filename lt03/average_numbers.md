# average_numbers

Write a program that takes several numbers as arguments and prints their average. Rounds the result to one digit after the decimal point.
If an invalid input (non-numeric argument) is encountered, the program should return nothing.

**Example:**

```sh
student:$ go run . 1 2 3 4
2.5
student:$ go run . 10 abc 30
```
