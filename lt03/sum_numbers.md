Sure, here is a more complex version of the `sum_numbers` task:

| Expected file         | Available                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `sum_numbers/main.go` | `github.com/alem-platform/ap`, `os` |

# sum_numbers

Write a program that takes several numbers as arguments and prints their sum. Additionally, the program should print the cumulative sum at each step.
If an invalid input (non-numeric argument) is encountered, the program should return nothing.

**Example:**

```sh
student:$ go run . 1 2 3 4
1
3
6
10
student:$ go run . 10 20 abc 30
```
