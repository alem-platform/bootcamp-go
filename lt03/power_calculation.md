# power_calculation

Write a program that takes two numbers as arguments and calculates the power (first number raised to the power of the second number). If an invalid input (non-numeric argument) is encountered or number of arguments is larger than `2`, the program should return nothing.

**Example:**

```sh
student:$ go run . 2 3
8
student:$ go run . 5 4
625
student:$ go run . 10 abc
```
