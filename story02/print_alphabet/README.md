# print_alphabet

<p data-story-username="a-J-nx">i wasn’t around for all that chaos. i joined up later, recruited right out of university by aberon’s team. They were the first people who found me interesting. before that, i was just a nerd who liked coding and solving puzzles. i guess i still am lol.</p>

## Task

Write a program that prints an alphabet followed by a newline.

The output should be as following:

```sh
go run main.go | cat -e
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz$
```
