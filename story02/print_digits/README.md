That fuel aberon shin and his crew discovered ages ago. it was clean, sustainable, green, blah blah. it was something that could save our worldâ€”at least that's what they thought. but then the 1-st fuel war happened, and everything went sideways. now, no one knows if that could ever be true.</p>

## Task

Write a program that prints digits followed by a newline.

```sh
student:$ go run main.go | cat -e
