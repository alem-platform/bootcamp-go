# print_square

<p data-story-username="a-J-nx">so, you’ve seen a bit of what we’re up against. a bunch of old code, encrypted, restored, and the energy raiders on our tail. we really need people to help us find the formula before they do. this is what all of this is about—your trial, this garage, everything. i hope it will make sense to you too.</p>

## Task

Write a function `PrintSquare` that draws a square with a given width.

**Function definition:**

```go
func PrintSquare(w int) {

}
```

Example:

```go
func main() {
    PrintSquare(3)
    // Output:
	// 0 0 0
	// 0 0 0
	// 0 0 0
}
```
