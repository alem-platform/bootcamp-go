<p data-story-username="a-J-nx">so, what’s the deal? why are we doing this? Well, for me, it’s the challenge. I love coding and problem-solving. and Aberon’s team gave me a place where i felt like i belonged. sometimes i think i don’t really care about the clean energy, just about the good company.</p>
